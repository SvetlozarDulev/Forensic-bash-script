This script automates HDD and memory forensic analysis. 
It checks user permissions, validates input files, and installs missing tools if required. 
Using multiple carvers, it extracts data into organized directories, attempts to recover network traffic, and highlights human-readable artifacts. 
For memory analysis, it leverages Volatility to identify the profile, list processes, network connections, and registry data. 
Finally, it generates statistics, compiles results into a report, and compresses all outputs for easy review.
